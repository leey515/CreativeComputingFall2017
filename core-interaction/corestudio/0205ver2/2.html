        IT IS a truth universally acknowledged, that 

        I must have possession of a good fortune 

        I must be m want of a wife. 

        However little known the feelings or views of 
        such a man may be on his f^rst entering a neigh- 
        bourhood, this truth is so well f^xed in the mindf of 
        the surroundmg families, that he is considered as 
        the rightful property o some one or other of their 
        daughters. 

        " My dear Mr Bennet," said his lady to him one 

        at firt heard that Nethcrfield Park is let 

        Mr Bennet replied that he had not 

        " But it is," returned she; " for Mrs Long has 
        just been here, and she told me all about it." 

        Mr Bennt made no answer. 

        Do not you want to know who has taken it ? 
        cried his wife inipatientlv. 

        Tou want to tell me, and I have no objection 
        to hearing it.

        This was invitation enough. 

        dear, you must know, Mrs Lone 

        ays that Netherfield is taken by a voung man of 

        large fortune from the north of England for the 

        came down on Monday in a ehaise and four to see

        the place, a id was so much delighted with it, that 
        he agreed with Mr Morris immediately; that he is 
        to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of 
        his ervants arc to be in the house bv the end of 
        next week.

         What is his name?

         Bingley.

        Is he married or single?

         Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man 
        of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. 
        What a fine thing for our girls ! 

        How so? how can it affect them? 

        My dear Mr Bennet, replied his wife, how 
        can you be so tiresome! you must know that I am 
        thinking of his marrying one of them.

         Is that his design in settling here? 

        Design ! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it 
        is very likely that he may fall in love with one of 
        them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as 
        he comes.

        I see no occasion for that. You and the ^irls 
        may go, or you may send them by themselves, 
        which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as 
        handsome as any of them, Mr Bingley might like 
        you the best of the party.

         My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had 
        my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be 
        anything extraordinary now. When a woman has 
        five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over 
        thinking of her own beauty. 

         In such cases, a woman has not often much 
        beauty to think of.  </p>
