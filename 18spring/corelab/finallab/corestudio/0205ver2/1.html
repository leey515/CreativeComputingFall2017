        <h1> About Jane Austen </h1>

        <p class="reading">

            IT is impossible, I think, to resist the impression 
            that ElizabctJi and Jane Bcnnct were drawn, 
            more or less consciously, from Jane Austen her- 
            self and her favourite sister, Cassandra. Jane's unti- 
            ring good-nature is never insipid, and she is de- 
            scribed with a tender affection and sisterly pride 
            which mark the inspiration of a living model. 

            " You are a great deal too apt, you know," says 
            her more sprightly sister, "to like people in general. 
            You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are 
            good and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you 
            speak ill of a human being in my life." 

            " I would not wish to be hasty in censuring any 
            one; but I always speak what I think." 

            " I know you do, and it is that which makes the 
            wonder. With your good sense, to be so honestly 
            blind to the follies and nonsense of others! Affec- 
            tation of candour is common enough one meets it 
            everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation 
            or design to take the good of everybody's charac- 
            ter and make it still better, and say nothing of the 
            bad belongs to you alone." 

            Every allusion to Jane Bennet breathes the same 
            spiilr; and we cannot mistake its echo in Miss 
            Austen's published correspondence, of which Cas- 
            sandra, indeed, is the leading figure.  </p>
