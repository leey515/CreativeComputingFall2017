            " But, my dear, you must indeed go ai I see Mr 
            Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood." 
            '' It is more than I engage for, I assure you." 
            " But consider your daughters. Only think what 
            an_ establishment it would be for one of them. Sir 
            William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, 
            merely on that account, for in general, you know,' 
            they visit no new-comers. Indeed vou' must go, 
            fo: it will be impossible for tu to visit'him if vou do 
            not." 

            " You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say >.Ir 
            Bmglev' win be ver> glad to see you; and I will 
            send a few lines by you to assure hi'm of mv hearty 
            consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of 
            the girls; though I must throw in a good word for 
            my little Lizzv." 

            " I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy ie not 
            a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is 
            not hah so handsome as Jane, nor half so good- 
            Iiumoured as Lydia. But you are alwavs giving her 
            the preference." 

            They have none of them much to recommend 
            them," replied he; " they are all silly and ignorant, 
            like other girls; but Lizzie has something more of 
            quickness than her sisters." 

            " Mr Bennet, how can you abuse your own 
            children in such a way.? You take delight' in vexing 
            me. You have no compassion on mv poor nerves." 

            " Yoa mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect 
            for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have 
            heard you mention them with consideration these 
            twenty years at least." 



            4 PRIDE AND PREJUDICE 

            " Ah! you do not know what I suffer." 

            " But I hope you will get over it, and live to see 
            manv young men of four thcnsand a j-ear come 
            into the neighbourhood." 

            " It will be no use to us if twenty such should 
            come, since you will not visit them." 

            " Depend upon it, m)' dear, that when there are 
            twenty, I will vi;>it them all." 

            Mr Bcnnet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, 
            sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the 
            experience of three-and-twenty years had been in- 
            sufficient to make his wife understand his charac- 
            ter. Her mind was less difficult to develop. She was 
            a woman oi' mean understanding, little informa- 
            tion, and uncertain temper. When she was dis- 
            contented she fancied herself nervous. The busi- 
            ness of her life was to get her daughters married; 
            its solace was visiting and news. 



            CHAPTER II 

            MR BEX NET was among the earliest of 
            those who waited on Mr Bingley. He had 
            always intended to visit him, though to the last 
            always assuring his wife that he should not go; and 
            till the evening after the visit was paid she had no 
            knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the fol- 
            lowing manner. Observing his second daughter 
            employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly ad- 
            dressed her with: 

            " I hope Mr Bingley will like it, Lizzy." 

            " We are not in a way to know ichat Mr Bingley 
            likes," said her mother resentfully, " since we are 
            not to visit." 

            " But you forget, mamma," said Elizabeth, 
            " that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and 
            that Mrs Long has promised to introduce him." 

            " I do not believe Mrs Long will do any such 
            thing. She has two nieces of her own. She is a 
            selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion 
            of her." ^ 

            " No more have '," said xMr Bennet; " and I am 
            glad to find ths^ you do not depend on her serving 
            you." 

            Mrs Bennet deigned not to make any reply, 
            but, unable to contain herself, began scolding one 
            of her daughters. 

            " Don't keep coughing bo, Kitty, for Heaven's 



            6 PklDI. AM) PRFJIOICI, 

            sake! Hi. a little compassion on my nerves. Voii 
            tear them to pieces." 

            " Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said 
            her father; " she times them ill." 

            " I do not cough for my own airiuscmcnt," re- 
            plied Kitty fretfully. " When is your net ball to 
            be, Lizzie? " 

            " T(j-morrow fortnight." 

            ''A)-, so it is," cried her mother, "and Mrs 
            Long docs not come back till tJie day before; so it 
            will be impossible for her to introduce him, for 
            she will not know him herself." 

            " Tlicn, my dear. )ou ma\- have the advantage 
            of your friend, and introduce Mr Binglev to Zvr." 

            " Lnpossible, Mr Bennct, impossible, when I 
            am not acc]uaintcd with him myself; how can you 
            be so teasing? " 

            I honour \ our circumspection. A fortnight's 
            acquaintance is certainly xcvy little. One cannot 
            know what a man really is by the end of a fort- 
            night. But if zee do not venture somebody else will; 
            and after all, Mrs Long and her nieces must stand 
            their chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an 
            act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take 
            it on myself." 

            The girls stared at their father. Mrs Bennet said 
            onl}-, " Nonsense, nonsense!" 

            " What can be the meaning of taat emphatic 
            exclamation?" cried he. '* Do you consider the 
            forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on 
            them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you 


            lady of deep retiection, I know, and read great 
            books and make extracts." 

            Mary wished to say something very sensible, 
            but knew not how. 

            " While Mary is adjusting lier idea-," he con- 
            tinued, " let us return to Mr Bingley." 

            '' I am sick of Mr Bingley," cried his wife. 

            " I am sorry to liear that; but vvh) did ikjI you 
            tell mc so before? If 1 had known as much this 
            morning I certainly would ncjt ha\e called on him. 
            It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the 
            visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now." 

            The astonishment n{ the ladies was just what he 
            wished; that of Mrs Bennet perhaps surpassing the 
            rest; though, when the first tumult of joy was 
            over, she began to declare that it was what she had 
            expected all the wliile. 

            " How good it was in you, my dear Mr Bennet! 
            But I knew I should persuade you at last. I was 
            sure you loved \our giris too well to ni'glect such 
            an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is 
            such a good joke, too, that you should have gone 
            this morning and never said a word about it till 
            now." 

            " Now, Kitty, you ma\- cough as much as you 
            choose," said Mr Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left 
            the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife. 

            What an excellent father }'ou have, girls!" 
            said she, when the door was shut. '" I do not know 
            how you will ever make him amends for his kind- 
            ness; or me either, for that matter. At our time of 
            life il is nwt so p^leasant, I can lell ycai, to be making 



            8 PRTDE AND PREJUDICK 

            new acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, 
            we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though 
            you are the youngest, I dare say Mr Bingley will 
            dance with you at the next ball." 

            " Oh! " said Lydia, stoutly, " I am not afraid: 
            for though I am the youngest, I'm the tallest." 

            The rest of the evening was spent in conjectur- 
            ing how soon he would return Mr Bcnnct's visit, 
            and determining when they should ask him to 
            dinner.
